After some testing today and yesterday, I decided that the project is ready for submission. There is still some stuff, that could be done better, but since the deadline is in a few hours, I decided to put aside my self criticism. The dialect for google voice recognition is set to AE. I wasn't sure about it, since the exhibition is in Britain, but I thought most testers will have more of an AE dialect than a BE one. I made some AE/BE compatibility changes in my last commit, so changing it to BE (if wanted) is as simpe as resetting a variable at the bottom to "en-GB". I hope it is indeed a surreal experience and a thought provoking piece. Have fun with it, and since it is under the Apache Licence, build something on top of it, if you like.
