The original project idea came to me, when I read about William Borroughs cut-up method. Instead of just reflecting his inner self, he used the cut-up to reveal the chaotic system of the unconscious. As one randomly seperates and reassembles written thought, a new underlying meaning is revealed that was hidden from the eye. This way cut-ups are in the tradition of surrealist writing techniques such as the automatic writing by Andre Breton. They are a way to create something unknown from the known. In this work I'm trying to push this idea further.

In modern society the screen allegedly shows the total truth, be it on the TV, flashing billboards, in chinema or on the smartphone display. Digital Technology has widened its presence and put interactivity on top of it, but still the viewer keeps somewhat passive as he keeps in the bubble and only consumes a specific set of desired information. Activity on digital devices is mainly restricted to requesting information and the value of the device is measured by the quantity of fitting information it delivers. This way digital technology becomes a self-feeding cybernetic circle, which stabilizes inner emotional processes, opinions and ways of thinking. The idea behind Distorted Narratives is to counter-act this trend by temporarily alienating the user from his speech and actions in a digital setting in order to put an emotional progress in motion.
