I made some changes today. Since the replace "algorithm" used in this piece is very simple, I had to make some bugfixes and workarounds. (e.g. car also was replaced as the vehicle when found in cardboard or carrot). I thought about implementing a good parser, that replaces structures instead of only words, but the limited time frame (considering I first heard about the competition 5 days ago), made it impossible. Still if you are following me on github, chances are high, that there will be a more sophisticated version some day.
