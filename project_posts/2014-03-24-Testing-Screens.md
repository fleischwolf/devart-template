Just a quick look at the work, it's input and output. Firstly you get prompted by an orange text.

The prompt will appear everytime the microphone doesn't get a signal for a period of time. In the first example I said "I was playing with my shovel in the sandbox, when my mom called me" and got:

As you can see the new words are highlighted slightly. I used a thought of Jung in which hares are symbols of mothers and motherhood, as well as the obverservation, that a little shovel in the hands of a child can be a dangerous weapon. 

In the next one I said "My father came back from work and caught me wathing TV" and got:

The Priest as a mighty father figure is inspired by Bunuels movie "The discrete Charme of the Bourgeoisie". I should add that substitute words are picked somewhat random. There are different substitutes for each word, e.g. "my father" can turn out as "a local police officer", "the judge" and other similar substitutes.
