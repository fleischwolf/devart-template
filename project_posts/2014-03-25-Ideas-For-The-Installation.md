I've had some ideas about interesting installation settings I want to share. Of course one could just place a big dusty microphone in the middle of the room together with the screen, but maybe other experiments are cool to:

1. Place the microphone in a completely different room than the screen without any reference to it, just on a socket or in a little noise canceling box around it, where you can stick your head in.

2. Place the microphone in a confession box, like the ones you find in catholic churches, and put the screen on the outside of its walls (Does only work, if a huge screen isn't a requirement)

3. Mimick a playground in the microphone area, like you have to sit on a swing or stand in a sandbox

4. If screen and mic are placed in the same room, the room should be pitch dark and noise canceled. Not only to guarantee a better voice recognition, but to add to the atmosphere of being in an otherwordly space.

Note: If the microphone is in a different room, one should remove the prompt from the screen application.
