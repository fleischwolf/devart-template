# Distorted Narratives
by Fabian Vallon

## Description
Using the Google Voice Recognition API Distorted Narratives asks you to tell a short story about your childhood and rephrases it as a surreal text on screen. Referencing freudian dream symbols and jungian archetype theory, the installation is aimed to represent the memory as it was something surpressed now articulating itself in the dream of an adult.
